            <p>Picture this - freshly baked rich chocolate cake with a thick layer of chocolate 
                sauce on the top; sounds delicious, isn't it? If you are like us, then you understand 
                how versatile a bottle of chocolate sauce can be. Spread it on the cake, or ice cream,
                better still add it to your milkshake, a decent amount of chocolate sauce can make
                anything taste better. We love having chocolate sauce with toasted bread and biscuits
                too - which means, you can go as creative as you want with a bottle of chocolate 
                sauce at home. What if you suddenly run out of the sauce while baking a cake?! The
                most common reply will be, going to the nearest grocery store and getting hold of a
                new bottle. But we say, why to step out when you can make the chocolate sauce while
                sitting at home?! You heard us.</p>
