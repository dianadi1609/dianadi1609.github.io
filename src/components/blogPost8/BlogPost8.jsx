            <h4>To begin with the recipe, dissolve sugar in a quarter cup of lukewarm water, add yeast 
                to it and mix it and keep it aside for some time.</h4>
            <h4>Now take all-purpose flour (maida) in a big bowl, add salt, garlic powder and oregano 
                and mix it well. In between this time the yeast will become fluffy, add it to the maida,
                 mix it and knead a soft dough. Pour some oil on the dough and once again knead it and
                 keep it aside.</h4>
            <h4>Yes, you read it right, potato chips can be used to coat fried foods and the results
                 are actually much better than what you can imagine them to be! You may use the 
                 classic salted flavour, crush the chips into tiny pieces and coat the chicken or
                  other ingredients. Freeze for 5-10 minutes so the chips and the batter holding them 
                  on the surface dries up. Heat oil, fry until golden, and enjoy!</h4>
