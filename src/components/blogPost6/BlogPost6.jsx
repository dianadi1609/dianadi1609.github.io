                <p>Now that it finally feels like we are done with the third wave of the COVID 19, 
                    schools, offices, and many government organisations are being opened to the public.
                    Empty roads and vacant offices have sprung back into action and we are once again
                    ready to throw ourselves into the hustle and bustle of city life. We are slowly 
                    getting back to the normal state of existence, one that is free from all the
                    work-from-home shenanigans. This means no more weekday brunches and no more lazy 
                    meals in your pyjamas. It is time to pack that lunch and get going for the day. </p>
