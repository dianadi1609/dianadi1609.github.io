            <p>Ever wondered why nutritionists and experts recommend protein-rich dinner? Well,
                that's because protein is one of the most important nutrients that our body
                needs for muscular strength and to build skin and hair tissue. If you are 
                on a weight loss diet, a protein-rich diet is utterly important. However, 
                due to our hectic schedule we hardly get time to cook something extravagant.
                Hence, we all look for something easy and quick to make for dinner. Keeping
                this in mind, here we have something for you. Something that may surprise
                you. We bring you a list of 5 protein-rich dinner recipes that you can rustle
                up in just 20 minutes. Yes, you heard us! To make these recipes, you need
                very basic ingredients. For instance, paneer, dal, eggs. So, without much
                ado, let's see what these recipes are and how can we make them at home.</p>
