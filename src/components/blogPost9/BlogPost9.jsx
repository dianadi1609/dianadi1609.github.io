            <p>Indian meals consist of a variety of items. Be it dal, roti, rice, sabzi, salad, achar
                and even chutneys. All these things complete our thalis and leave us drooling. 
                However, many people conceive of chutney just as a side dish to accompany a meal.
                But, its importance in Indian cuisine is so much more than that. It not only adds
                flavours to our meals but also gives a punch of nutrition. In different houses,
                chutneys are made in various ways. Although, the goal is the same- to make a
                side dish that will add variety to your meals. Till now, we are sure that you
                have made all kinds of chutneys like imly, pudina, peanut, coconut, tomato,
                and even mango or amla chutney, so to give that a twist, here we have a new recipe.</p>
