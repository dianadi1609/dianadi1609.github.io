Biscuits:</h3>\n            <h4>You need to be a little careful when using biscuits for coating foods. Not all biscuits\n                 will work for the process and make sure not to make a very fine powder out of them.\n                  Use biscuits with mild flavours like Marie or even rusk biscuits. If crackers are\n                 available near you, they work great for the process too!</h4>\n        </div>\n        <div className= 'advertflex'>\n            <h2>Don’t forget to eat<br /> healthy food</h2>\n            <img className= 'adv' src={adv} alt=\"Advertisement.\" />\n            <img className= 'star' src={star} alt=\"Star.\" />\n        </div>\n        </div>\n        </>\n    )\n}\nexport default BlogPost7;\n"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAO,0BAA0B;AACjC,OAAOA,QAAQ,MAAM,+BAA+B;AACpD,OAAOC,SAAS,MAAM,gCAAgC;AACtD,OAAOC,GAAG,MAAM,0BAA0B;AAC1C,OAAOC,IAAI,MAAM,2BAA2B;AAAC,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAAA,SAAAC,QAAA,IAAAC,SAAA;AAG7C,SAASC,SAASA,CAAA,EAAI;EAClB,oBACIH,OAAA,CAAAE,SAAA;IAAAE,QAAA,gBACDJ,OAAA;MAAKK,SAAS,EAAC,YAAY;MAAAD,QAAA,gBACtBJ,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;MAA+D;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACxET,OAAA;QAAKK,SAAS,EAAC,SAAS;QAAAD,QAAA,gBACxBJ,OAAA;UAAKK,SAAS,EAAC,YAAY;UAAAD,QAAA,gBAC3BJ,OAAA;YAAKK,SAAS,EAAC,UAAU;YAAAD,QAAA,eACrBJ,OAAA;cAAKU,GAAG,EAAEd,SAAU;cAACe,GAAG,EAAC;YAAW;cAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAE;UAAC;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACtC,CAAC,eACNT,OAAA;YAAKK,SAAS,EAAE,YAAY;YAAAD,QAAA,eACxBJ,OAAA;cAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;YAAW;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,OAAI;UAAC;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OACnB,CAAC;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACD,CAAC,eACNT,OAAA;UAAKK,SAAS,EAAE,aAAa;UAAAD,QAAA,eACzBJ,OAAA;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;UAAc;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAI;QAAC;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OACtB,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACL,CAAC,eACFT,OAAA;QAAGK,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;QAAAD,QAAA,EAAC;MACa;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAC1CT,OAAA;QAAGK,SAAS,EAAC,YAAY;QAAAD,QAAA,eACzBJ,OAAA;UAAKU,GAAG,EAAEf,QAAS;UAACgB,GAAG,EAAC;QAAQ;UAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAE;MAAC;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAChC,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACH,CAAC,eACNT,OAAA;MAAKK,SAAS,EAAC,SAAS;MAAAD,QAAA,eAChBJ,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;MAMkE;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG;IAAC;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAC5E,CAAC,eACNT,OAAA;MAAKK,SAAS,EAAC,gBAAgB;MAAAD,QAAA,gBAC/BJ,OAAA;QAAKK,SAAS,EAAC,aAAa;QAAAD,QAAA,gBACxBJ,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;QAAgE;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACzET,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;QAAc;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACvBT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;QAGY;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACrBT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;QAAe;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACxBT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;QAGmC;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC5CT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;QAAgB;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACzBT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;QAIiE;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC1ET,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;QAAmB;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC5BT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;QAEmF;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC5FT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;QAAY;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACrBT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;QAGyD;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACjE,CAAC,eACNT,OAAA;QAAKK,SAAS,EAAE,YAAY;QAAAD,QAAA,gBACxBJ,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,GAAI,0BAAmB,eAAAJ,OAAA;YAAAM,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,OAAK,CAAC,iBAAa;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC/CT,OAAA;UAAKK,SAAS,EAAE,KAAK;UAACK,GAAG,EAAEb,GAAI;UAACc,GAAG,EAAC;QAAgB;UAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAE,CAAC,eACvDT,OAAA;UAAKK,SAAS,EAAE,MAAM;UAACK,GAAG,EAAEZ,IAAK;UAACa,GAAG,EAAC;QAAO;UAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAE,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAC/C,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACD,CAAC;EAAA,eACJ,CAAC;AAEX;AAACG,EAAA,GAtEQT,SAAS;AAuElB,eAAeA,SAAS;AAAC,IAAAS,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
